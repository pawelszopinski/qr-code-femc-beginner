## My process

I am starting without subscription so I ended up guessing margins etc. according to .jpg design images. Hope I guessed right.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned that warking in a team is different than working solo on the project. Communication and task priorities are crucial!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Default Browser Values](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css_default_values.php) - This helped me to find default margin that was stretching my body tag. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
